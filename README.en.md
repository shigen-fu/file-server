# üßë‚Äçüíªfile-server introduction

A open-source LAN file transfer and sharing tool, if using a mobile device, simply scan the QR code on the terminal or the QR code on the browser page to upload files. After uploading, the files will be displayed in a list format with detailed information such as file name, size, permissions, modification time, etc. Click the [Download] button to download the file to your device.

For specific usage, you can refer to the article by `shigen` : [Open Source a LAN File Sharing Tool](https://juejin.cn/post/7304268951298392114).

# üìágit repository

[file-server An open source LAN file sharing tool](https://github.com/shigen-fu/file-server.git)

# üü¢how to use

Just one command.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/shigen-fu/file-server.git && cd file-server && pip install -r requirements.txt && python app.py
```

## Dockerfile

`shigen` has been using macOS all along, so I didn't notice any issues. Finally, when he ported the project to the Windows platform, I encountered problems running Flask. Therefore, I added a Dockerfile to run the service directly in a Docker container. Below are the relevant commands:

```shell
docker build -t file-server:1.0.0 .
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name file-server -v $(pwd)/file:/app/upload file-server:1.0.0
```

> The initial build of Docker may take a long time because the official Python Docker image is around 1GB in size. Most of the time is spent pulling the image, so it's recommended to configure Docker with image acceleration.

You can first separately download the base image needed:

```shell
docker pull python:3.9
```

### Deployment Method Added on 24-4-25

If you find the above commands cumbersome to type, you can directly run the provided deployment script.

```shell
bash deploy.sh
```
